# game-on

Game-on  is a web app built using HTML, CSS, (Materialize Framework), Java Script, Node.js and Firebase.  The app is designed for gamers and sports fans alike to get together and enjoy doing things together with like minded people.  The app allows for users to either create an event or find an existing event in the area.  To create a gaming or sporting event on any given date in the future, the user will click on "Create an event" button.  The user enters the general information, and submit to create the event. The created event is stored in the firebase database, and is displated in the "Find events" page of the web app.  Instead of creating a new event, if a user wants to view existing events to join, the user will click the "Find an event" button.  This takes the user to the page that displays all the events in the area.  The events are displayed on the proximity of the zip code that the user enters before hitting the "Find an Event" button.  After clicking the "Find events" button, the user is directed to the sports or the games section of the events that are already in the database.  The user can see the local address (and the distance from their current address), and the details of the event.  

THe project roles of the team members is listed below:

The app was finished with a very tight deadline with little or no known knowledge of Firebase database before the start of the project!  The app is fully functional and appeals to sports and gaming fans alike.  More modifications and features such as user login will be added soon!
